Have we become complacent with providing strangers our personal data to get free offers and opt ins? Or have we come to accept this as a regular part of consumerism? With the rise in chatbots and AI-led applications and assistants, we as consumers are experiencing a level of 
service never experienced before. 
The trade off is what people are paying to obtain that convenience, and some are pushing back. The role of AI, however, will only increase over time. Should consumers be concerned? How will these changes in technology disrupt how businesses market and sell to consumers?
The use of chatbots is also on the rise. It’s a convenience for both consumers and businesses as a way to provide around-the-clock engagement on websites or applications. No need for customers to wait until office hours to ask a question. Businesses can provide information to consumers in the middle of the night.
However, chatbots cannot answer complex inquiries yet. At some point, human customer support may need to step in, and businesses shouldn’t lose that human touch with customers either.
